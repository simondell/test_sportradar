# Simon Dell's Sportradar Coding Challenge solution

## The challenge

Sportradar would like me to code a "socreboard library". The complete notes are in [./docs/Sportradar\ Coding\ Exercise\ 2024.pdf]().

## Decisions

- TypeScript - As a front-end engineer JavaScript is my core language, with TypeScript my preferred way to write it. 
- Mocha - the challenge asked to display a TDD approach, and I wanted to use the most minimal/lightweight but not esoteric tools (e.g. [Tape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape) is similarly light and I like it's "no globals" API, but it's less popular)
